## About Me
I'm a Finance student with a passion for Data science and statistics. Here I will be uploading my projects.

## Projects
- **Portfolio evaluation: (https://github.com/Geokaragiann/CV-Projects/Portfolio)**: This program recieves 2, or more tickers for stock market securities, their respective weight in the portfolio, and the total portfolio value in dollars, and it calculates the annualized return and standard deviation of the portfolio. It also calculates the Value at risk and CVaR. At the end, it also creates a histogram with the relevant data.
The code is provided both in the more adaptable and easy to use jupyter notebook form, and in a standard .py file.

-**To be added:** 
- The mean should be shown on the graph.
- The confidence interval should come from user input.
- The time period (365 days, 30 days, 5 days, whatever) should also come from user input.
- Find optimal weights using monte carlo simulation? Maybe this should be a different project.
