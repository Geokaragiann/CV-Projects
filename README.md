## Projects
- **Portfolio evaluation: (https://github.com/Geokaragiann/CV-Projects/tree/main/Portfolio_Evaluation)**:
This Python script provides portfolio analysis for Stock market Securities. Users can input their desired securities and allocation weights to analyze their portfolio's risk-return characteristics. The tool calculates key metrics, including annualized returns (with compounding), volatility, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown. It features risk analysis through Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional VaR (CVaR) calculations, and evaluates portfolio diversification using the Diversification Ratio. It includes visual representations of return distributions. It is indended to aid in understanding a portfolio's risk-adjusted performance and diversification effectiveness.

    - Key features:
        
        - Historical return and risk metrics
        - Portfolio diversification analysis
        - Risk measures (VaR, CVaR)
        - Visual distribution of returns
        - Interactive weight allocation
The code is provided both in the more adaptable and easy to use Jupyter notebook form, and in a standard .py file.
