## About Me
I'm a Finance student with a passion for Data analysis. Here I will be uploading my projects.

## Projects
- **Portfolio evaluation: (https://github.com/Geokaragiann/CV-Projects/Portfolio)**: This program recieves 1, 2, or more tickers for stock market securities, and their respective 
weight in the portfolio, and calculates the annualized return and standard deviation of the portfolio. It also calculates the probability that the portfolio will have an annual return over x% (Currently removed due to issues, will be reimplemented).
The code is provided both in the more adaptable and easy to use jupyter notebook form, and in a standard .py file.
